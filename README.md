# TurnBasedRPG
A small project for my CSP Performance Task

Things to add:

-Fix code so it doesn't say "Enemy turn, enemy did 15 damage!" at the end of the code and says "name wins/loses!"

-Find out how to count the amount of turns someone took in a fight and just display it for now.

-Add different colors to text to bring attention to them (colored sp notifications)
